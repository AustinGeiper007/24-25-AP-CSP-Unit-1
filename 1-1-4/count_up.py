# Selected numbers for this example are 11 and 852
#Challenge: Write a while loop that counts up to 852 but not over, by 11

total = 0

while total + 11 <= 852:
    total = total + 11

print("Your total is" + str(total))
print("Which is as high as you can go")
print("counting by 11, without exceeding 852")
